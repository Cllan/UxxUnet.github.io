# Tutorials: Blog built on Github (for amateurs)

Building a blog has always been a dream of mine. Recording every bit of growth and knowledgy newly learnt makes me feel good. Thus I open this blog.

## Introduction
Among all the way to build a personal lightweight blog, building on github is one of the quikest and easiest way for amateur, in my perspective. In this blog, I'm going to inctroduce the way I learnt to build a blog on github. The blog is built by Jekyll but you don't need to bother that thanks to github. The best and clearest tutotial I learnt from is from [qiubaiying](https://github.com/qiubaiying/qiubaiying.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2017-02-06-%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E6%90%AD%E5%BB%BA%E4%B8%AA%E4%BA%BA%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%A2.md), in Chinese though. Again, it's for progam amateurs and you can have your own blog page within 1 minus.

## Environment
Windows 7

## Requirement
A browser 

An email address

There are several good collections with tons of excellent resources. Here recommands [Jekyll.Wiki](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites) . 

3. **Fork** it or download it. 
Find the github repository of your favored template and fork it or download it. Mine is downloaded from [Suyan](https://github.com/suyan/). You can fork [mine](https://github.com/UxxUnet/UxxUnet.github.io) if you like it,

Now, your blog is already online!!!

**!!!!!!**

Just that easy,uh! Tell me how many seconds you cost!

If you still don't believe, enter `yourusername.github.io` in your address bar of your browser.

Of cause, it still looks the same with mine but just a little more settings it will turn to yours completely. 


6. Open the _config.yml file in your browser.

Open your repository in your github page and find the _config.yml file. Open it.

7. Change the profile accordingly.

Items you need to change include: title, email, description, url(your blog address), author, social account(if you have one and keep it empty if you don't), disqus(empty it if you don't have one), ga(empty it if you don't have one)

Now, the blog is yours,,, except the content. You can change the content of README.md and index.md in the browser as well. 

Here comes the last step: write your own blog!

8. Download **GitHub DeskTop** and clone your repository into computer.

Find the files named yourusername.github.io and the blogs are saved in the file _posts. Delete all the files in it and start to create your own.
