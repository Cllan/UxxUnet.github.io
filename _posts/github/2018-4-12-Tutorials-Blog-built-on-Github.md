# Tutorials: Blog built on Github (for amateurs)

Building a blog has always been a dream of mine. Recording every bit of growth and knowledgy newly learnt makes me feel good. Thus I open this blog.

## Introduction
Among all the way to build a personal lightweight blog, building on github is one of the quikest and easiest way for amateur, in my perspective. In this blog, I'm going to inctroduce the way I learnt to build a blog on github. The blog is built by Jekyll but you don't need to bother that thanks to github. The best and clearest tutotial I learnt from is from [qiubaiying](https://github.com/qiubaiying/qiubaiying.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2017-02-06-%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E6%90%AD%E5%BB%BA%E4%B8%AA%E4%BA%BA%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%A2.md), in Chinese though. Again, it's for progam amateurs and you can do this within 30 min.
