## About me

Around the beginning of 2018, I decided to devote myself into bioinformation & biostatistics after quiting from a biochemistry Ph.D program. As a newbie into bioinformation & biostatistics, I open a blog to record my growth.

## About the blog

This blog is built by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) , deploying at [Github](https://pages.github.com)ï¼Œbased on [3-Jekyll](https://github.com/P233/3-Jekyll). Thanks to  [Suyan](https://github.com/suyan/), the blog is forked from his [repository](https://github.com/suyan/suyan.github.io) and built with the help of his tutorials.
